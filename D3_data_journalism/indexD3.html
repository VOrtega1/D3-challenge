            <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Income</h2>
            <p>Nationally, more than two million poor uninsured adults fell into the “coverage gap” that results from state decisions not to expand Medicaid, meaning their income was above Medicaid eligibility but below the lower limit for Marketplace premium tax credits. These individuals would be eligible for Medicaid had their state chosen to expand coverage.</p>

            <p>Adults left in the coverage gap are spread across the states not expanding their Medicaid programs but are concentrated in states with the largest uninsured populations. More than a third of people in the coverage gap reside in Texas.</p>

            <p> Because this data predates the pandemic and associated job and income loss, it is likely that the number of people in the coverage gap has grown since the start of the pandemic, and these estimates may be a lower bound of how many people are currently in the coverage gap.</p>
